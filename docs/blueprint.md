## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Ember Orange (#E07A5F) to evoke warmth and appetite, reflecting the 'Blazeburn' concept. The color choice moves slightly away from literal fire colors, and aims at reflecting warmth.
- Background color: Light Sand (#F4F1DE), a very desaturated tint of the primary, providing a neutral backdrop that keeps the emphasis on the restaurant content.
- Accent color: Charcoal Brown (#3D405B) to create contrast for call-to-action buttons and important information.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a clear and versatile sans-serif font suitable for all body text and longer descriptions.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a stylish and slightly high-contrast sans-serif to emphasize headings and sections, combined with the more practical PT Sans for body text.
- Use clean and minimalist icons for navigation and calls to action. The icons should complement the overall design and be easily understandable.
- A grid-based layout to present content in an organized and visually appealing manner.
- Subtle hover effects on menu items and buttons to provide visual feedback to the user. Transition effects for image loading.
